==================================

System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  
Tool Used: https://www.passwordmeter.com/

Objective:
----------
To create multiple passwords, test their strength, and learn best practices for secure password creation.

Passwords Tested and Results:
-----------------------------

1. Password: `Password123`
   - Score: 30%
   - Feedback: Too common, lacks special characters.

2. Password: `K@rTh!k@2024`
   - Score: 80%
   - Feedback: Strong password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

3. Password: `tadiPurnaK@rthik#57`
   - Score: 95%
   - Feedback: Very strong — long length, mixed case, symbols, and numbers.

4. Password: `12345678`
   - Score: 10%
   - Feedback: Extremely weak — predictable and widely used.

5. Password: `Ubuntu_Rocks@22`
   - Score: 85%
   - Feedback: Good complexity and length.

Best Practices Learned:
------------------------

- Use a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Passwords should be at least 12 characters long.
- Avoid using personal information or common patterns (like "123456").
- Passphrases (random or memorable word combinations) are both strong and user-friendly.

Common Password Attacks:
-------------------------

- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all possible combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Tries common words and passwords.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Uses leaked usernames and passwords from data breaches.

Conclusion:
-----------
Longer, more complex passwords significantly increase resistance to attacks. Using a password manager and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) are recommended for improved security.
