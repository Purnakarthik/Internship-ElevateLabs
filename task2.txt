Task 2: Phishing Email Analysis 

**************** Email Summary ***************
Subject: Microsoft account password change

Sender: support@msupdate.net

Recipient: ethan@hooksecurity.co

Time: 4:09 PM

*************** Phishing Indicators Identified *********************
Spoofed Sender Address :

The email claims to be from Microsoft but is sent from support@msupdate.net, which is not a legitimate Microsoft domain.

Suspicious Links :

The message contains multiple action links (e.g., reset password, review info) which could lead to fake login pages. Legitimate Microsoft emails usually include verified links under the microsoft.com domain.

Urgency and Threat Language :

The message says “If this wasn't you, your account has been compromised,” creating a sense of urgency and fear, a common tactic in phishing attempts.

Lack of Personalization :

No username, account ID, or personal reference is used. Generic greetings suggest the email was sent in bulk.

Unverified Design Elements :

While the formatting looks professional, there’s no official branding, digital signature, or Microsoft security footer, which are typically present in real Microsoft emails.

No Contact Verification :

The email lacks any verifiable contact information or official Microsoft support links.

**************** Tools & Techniques Used *******************************
->  Manual email inspection

->  Link hover analysis (recommended for live emails)

->  Basic domain analysis of sender email

**************** Conclusion *************************************
This email is very likely a phishing attempt. It impersonates Microsoft, uses a spoofed sender domain, creates urgency, and encourages the user to click on potentially harmful links.

***************** Recommendations ***********************
->  Do not click on any links or download attachments from suspicious emails.

->  Verify sender domains carefully. Official emails from Microsoft will come from @microsoft.com.

->  Report phishing emails to your email provider or internal security team.

->  Use email header analyzers for deeper inspection if headers are available.
